    "# Visualizing data in Python\n",
    "**by [Richard W. Evans](https://sites.google.com/site/rickecon/), June 2018**\n",
    "\n",
    "A picture is worth a thousand words. In fact, most journal articles can be summarized by one good figure or one good table. This conjecture makes for a good rule for any researcher. \"What is the best picture or table that can summarize the story I want to tell with my results.\" This section will focus on using data visualization as preliminary a way for understanding and interpreting your data. This chapter is about using visualization for exploring your data. But the principles can be applied to the later steps of presenting your results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard visualizations of any data are the scatterplot, the line plot, the bar graph, the histogram (a particular type of bar graph), There are 3-D versions of all of these. Then there are ways to allow each of these methods to display more than three dimensions of the data. Finally, recent developments in D3 (data-driven documents) JavaScript visualizations for web browsers have made interactive graphics available to the common internet user via flyover display, toggle switches, slider bars, and other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on Python's `matplotlib` visualization package. But many other libraries exist in Python (e.g.scikitlearn, chaco, mayavi, bokeh), and many other programming platforms also have powerful visualization packages (e.g., R, Stata, SAS, MATLAB, Mathematica)."

    "The Chernoff face is an interesting way to compare data visually in a way that simultaneously presents as many dimensions of the data as you want. Chernoff (1973) proposed using an image that associates different attributes of the image to variables in the data. For example, the size of the nose might represent the variable \"wind speed\", the color of the skin might represent \"temperature\", the openness of the eyes might represents \"time of day\", and the length of the hair might represent \"age\". The only limit to the dimensionality is how many characteristics you can put on the face. Also note that it is valuable that there be some intuitive association between the variable and the characteristic of the glyph. And, of course, the image could be anything besides a face."
